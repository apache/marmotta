/**
 * KiWiResources correspond to RDF resources. A KiWi resource is either an anonymous 
 * resource or a URIResource. A KiWiResource represents an RDF resource. However, there
 * is no 1:1 correspondance, as there may be several KiWiResources in different
 * KnowledgeSpaces that represent the same RDF resource.
 * <p>
 * Each KiWiResource has a 1:1 correspondance to a content item. Each KiWiResource is 
 * also directly related with a Sesame 2 resource in the knowledge base backend. 
 * The kiwi.sesame package contains appropriate adaptors for transforming Sesame 2 
 * resources into KiWiResources.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Each KiWiResoure furthermore participates in exactly one knowledge space, where the RDF 
 * resource may have different identifiers for the users. This knowledge space defines the 
 * getTripleStore().of the node. For this reason, a Sesame 2 Value may correspond to several
 * KiWiNodes in different knowledge spaces.
 * <p>
 * TODO: we could further simplify the data model by treating TextContent and MediaContent
 * as literals that are in a certain relation with the resource ("kiwi:hasTextContent",
 * "kiwi:hasMediaContent") and introducing the following new literal types:
 * KiWiTextContentLiteral
 * KiWiMediaContentLiteral
 * KiWiStringContentLiteral
 *
 * The class hierarchy should be changed so that from KiWiNode -> KiWiLiteral and from
 * KiWiNode -> KiWiResource there is joined subclass, and from there on single table
 *
 * currently existing functionality should be moved to ContentItemService
