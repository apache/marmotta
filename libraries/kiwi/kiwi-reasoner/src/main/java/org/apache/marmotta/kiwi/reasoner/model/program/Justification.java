/**
 * Reason Maintenance: A justification for the existence of a triple. The justification
 * contains a reference to the triple it supports and references to the triples and
 * rules that support this justification.
 * <p/>
 * A justification is created and stored each time a reasoning rule infers new triples.
 * Each of the inferred triples will be supported by the rules and base triples that
 * were used in the inference. This makes both explanations and maintenance much simpler,
 * i.e. when a base triple is deleted, we can remove all justifications that contain it
 * and then remove all inferred triples that are no longer supported by any justification.
