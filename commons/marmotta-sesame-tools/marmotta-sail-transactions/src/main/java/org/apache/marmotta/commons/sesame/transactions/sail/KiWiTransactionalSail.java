/**
 * This is an extended version of the KiWi triple store with support for transaction tracking. It offers the
 * possibility to register transaction listeners that are triggered whenever a connection commits or rolls back.
 * If the transaction commits, they are also passed over the transaction data, i.e. the added and removed triples.
 * <p/>
 * Note that even the basic KiWiStore offers transaction support by directly wrapping database transactions. The
 * extended transactions provided by the KiWiTransactionalStore are only necessary for getting access to the
 * transaction data and triggering actions on commit or rollback.s
