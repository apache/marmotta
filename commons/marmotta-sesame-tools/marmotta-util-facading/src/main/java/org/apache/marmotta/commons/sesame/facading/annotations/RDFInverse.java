/**
 * This annotation indicates that a certain KiWi facade field should be mapped
 * inversely to a property in the triple store. It is the inverse of the
 * <code>@RDF</code> annotation, e.g. when using
 * <code>@RDFInverse("rdfs:subClassOf")</code>, the annotated method returns the
 * subclasses, while the annotation <code>@RDF("rdfs:subClassOf")</code> would
 * return the superclasses. Note that <code>@RDFInverse</code> only works on
 * ObjectProperties; for all other properties it behaves exactly like
 * <code>@RDF</code>
 * <p>
 * The KiWiEntityManager and TripleStore check for the presence of this
 * annotation on methods and dynamically maps them to queries on the triple
 * store, using the resource of the annotated interface or class (which must
 * implement KiWiEntity to provide a getResource() method) as object.
 * <p>
 * This is a runtime annotation and it is applicable on getter methods.<br>
 * <p>
 * TODO: currently, only KiWiFacades are supported; also, it is currently not
 * possible to provide {@link @RDF} and {@link @RDFInverse} on the same method
 * at the same time.
