<h1><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction<a class="section_anchor" href="#Introduction"></a></h1>

<p>Apache Marmotta offers versioning services that keep track of any resource updates in the triple store.
    Versioning is transaction based, i.e. every time a transaction is committed successfully, a new version entry is
    created by the versioning services. Marmotta currently supports listing versions (system-wide and for a single resource)
    as well as inspecting "snapshots" (i.e. going back in time).
</p>


<h1><a name="Versions"></a>Version Access<a class="section_anchor" href="#Versions"></a></h1>

<p>
    Marmotta provides basic access to versioning information through the /versions web service:    
</p>
<ul>
    <li>/versions/list (optionally with parameters resource, offset, limit) will list all versions of the system or all versions of the specified resource</li>
    <li>/versions/{id} will display details about the version with the id {id}</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Be aware that listing all versions of the system might be a very expensive operation on large systems and
    should be used with care.
</p>

<h1><a name="Snapshots"></a>Snapshots<a class="section_anchor" href="#Snapshots"></a></h1>

<p>
    The Snapshot service (accessible under /snapshot) allows to access a resource as it used to be at a certain point in time. The /snapshot service accepts the
    following query parameters:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>resource=... - the URI of the resource of which to return the snapshot; needs to be URL-encoded; REQUIRED</li>
    <li>time=... - the time for which to return the snapshot; time is in ISO8601 or in GMT format and needs to be URL-encoded</li>
    <li>version=... - the ID of the version for which to return the snapshot</li>
</ul>
<p>
    The resource parameter is always required. Either the time or the version parameter must also be given. If both are present,
    the time parameter takes precedence.
</p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>
    Retrieve version 6 of resource http://localhost:8080/marmotta/resource/1234:
</p>
<pre>
    http://localhost:8080/marmotta/snapshot?resource=http%253A%252F%252Flocalhost%253A8080%252Fmarmotta%252Fresource%252F1234&version=6
</pre>


<h1><a name="Memento"></a>Memento Support<a class="section_anchor" href="#Memento"></a></h1>

<p>
    In case the versioning.memento configuration property is enabled, Marmotta also provides support for the
    <a href="http://www.mementoweb.org/guide/rfc/ID/">Memento specification</a>, which allows access to earlier
    versions of a resource through an extension of the HTTP protocol. 
</p>
<p>
    In case memento support is enabled, the Marmotta resource web service will produce additional "Link:" headers for
    each resource request pointing back to the Memento timegate service (located at /timegate?resource=...) provided
    by the versioning module. Depending on the Accept-Datetime header, the timegate service will redirect to the
    appropriate snapshot of the resource.
</p>
<p>
    Several tools exist for accessing Memento
    archives, e.g. the <a href="http://bit.ly/memento-for-chrome">Memento For Chrome</a> browser
    extension.
