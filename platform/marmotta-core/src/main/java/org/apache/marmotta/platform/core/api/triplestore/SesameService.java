/**
 * Offers access to the Sesame repository underlying this LMF instance. The activation/deactivation methods
 * of this service make sure the repository is properly initialised and shut down.
 * <p/>
 * Usage: to access the triple store properly through Sesame, you should follow the following
 * pattern:
 * <pre>
 *     RespositoryConnection con = sesameService.getConnection();
 *
 *     URI subject = con.getValueFactory().createURI(...);
 *     ...
 *     RepositoryResult&lt;Statement> result = con.getStatemenrs(subject,predicate,object,inferred,context);
 *     while(result.hasNext()) {
 *         Statement triple = result.next();
 *         ...
 *     }
 *
 *     con.close();
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p/>
 * Will replace the existing TripleStore at some point.
 * <p/>
