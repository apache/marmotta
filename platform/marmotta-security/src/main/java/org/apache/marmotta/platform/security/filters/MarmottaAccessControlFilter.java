/**
 * A filter providing basic access control for the Apache Marmotta. Makes use of container-managed
 * user authentication and security roles as provided e.g. by the {@link org.apache.marmotta.platform.user.filters.LMFAuthenticationFilter}.
 * <p/>
 * Whenever an HTTP request is received, the filter runs through the configured security constraints and checks
 * whether one of the constraints matches. In case the constraint is a permission, the execution proceeds. In
 * case the constraint is a restriction, an {@link AccessDeniedException} is thrown, which is then handled by
 * the LMFAuthenticationFilter.
