<h1>Storage Backend: BigData</h1>

<p>
    This module provides an Apache Marmotta storage backend based on the <a href="http://thinkaurelius.github.io/titan/">Titan</a>
    distributed graph database. Titan in itself supports various storage backends (HBase, Cassandra, ...), which you need to
    configure manually. This default installation uses the BerkleyDB backend for demonstration purposes.
