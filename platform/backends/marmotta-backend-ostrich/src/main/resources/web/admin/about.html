<h1>Storage Backend: LevelDB</h1>

<p>
    This module provides an Apache Marmotta storage backend based on a C++ LevelDB triple store (Ostrich). Ostrich is a highly scalable,
    highly performant, highly concurrent triple store implementation that you can use in cases where your volume of data is very high and/or
    you do not want/need to store your data in a relational database as with the KiWi backend.
