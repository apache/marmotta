<h1>Storage Backend: Accumulo</h1>

<p>
    This module provides an Apache Marmotta storage backend based on the <a href="https://github.com/JHUAPL/AccumuloGraph">the implementation of Tinkerpop Blueprints Accumulo backend.</a>
    Accumulo supports various instance types (Distributed, Mini, Mock), which you need to
    configure manually. This default installation uses Mock Accumulo backend for demonstration purposes.
