sparql.allow_origin.description = allowed origins for cross-site scripting (CORS)
sparql.allow_origin.type = java.lang.String


sparql.strategy.description = select the SPARQL evaluation strategy to use (default: sesame); other settings than \
  "sesame" allow to translate SPARQL queries directly to database queries; more efficient but not tested extensively
sparql.strategy.type = java.lang.Enum("native"|"sesame")


sparql.fallback.description = turn on/off fallback to Sesame in-memory SPARQL evaluation in case the default \
  evaluation strategy fails for whatever reason; this is a safe-guard option to always yield the correct results, \
  but suffers the memory and performance problems of the in-memory SPARQL evaulation
sparql.fallback.type = java.lang.Boolean

sparql.native.casttype.description = select the way literal types are handled in SPARQL queries in case they are \
  not correctly stored in the database or not properly given in the query; value "strict" means that the evaluator \
  always tries to cast a type appropriately, but can result in considerable performance impacts; value "loose" means \
  that all possible types are used, ignoring the type specification; value "none" means that no type casting takes \
  place, types are used as given by the user (this is the most efficient setting, but may be less tolerant to faulty \
  data or queries)
sparql.native.casttype.type = java.lang.Enum("none"|"loose"|"strict")


sparql.native.logsql.description = log SQL statements to the lmf-main.log file for testing and debugging
sparql.native.logsql.type = java.lang.Boolean


sparql.native.preload_constants.description = preload constant nodes in SPARQL expressions using the triple store \
  functionality; constant values in SPARQL expressions are substituted with the database ID of the respective nodes; \
  setting this option to true will reduce significantly the number of joins needed for a SPARQL query, but can require \
  database access at query construction time.
sparql.native.preload_constants.type = java.lang.Boolean

sparql.native.reduced_as_distinct.description = interpret the SPARQL REDUCED query parameter as distinct; the \
  specification for REDUCED says it is left to the query optimizer whether to make results distinct or not; DISTINCT \
  in SQL can introduce significant computational overhead, so the default is false
sparql.native.reduced_as_distinct.type = java.lang.Boolean
